# SX-64_8701
MOS8701 based replacement clock PCB for the Commodore SX-64.

There are two options for the crystal; 17.734475 MHz for PAL machines, 14.31818 MHZ for NTSC.
You need to close the solder jumper for PAL.

V1.0 used a pin jumper for PAL/NTSC selection and a through-hole Murata style trimmer capacitor.

V1.1 (first physical prototype). Solder jumper for PAL/NTSC and SMD trimmer capacitor.

V1.2 has the proper 'Y' designation for the crystal on the silkscreen.
